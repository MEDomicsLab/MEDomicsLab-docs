# 📄 Testing phase with MIMIC

## Overview

During the Winter 2024 semester, the first Testing Phase of MEDomicsLab (https://github.com/MEDomics-UdeS/MEDomicsLab) will take place via a series of tutorials. For an overview of the vision that we have for the platform, please visit this [link](https://bit.ly/3EdkQpi).

We would love to have you join the effort and provide feedback during this Testing Phase, prior to a first official release of MEDomicsLab! Our intent is to properly recognize all the participants of the Testing Phase when the first official release will come.

See the list of participants [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w4n2gygstxnrFSzAi1LqGsxgCVYa1Odyb8vl9huu-kU/).

We anticipate that the participation in the Testing Phase will involve 1 hour of work per week for 17 consecutive weeks, starting January 15, 2024. We are thinking of involving some mini-challenges with prizes, so this could be fun! Please also note that no programming is involved and that the tutorials can be performed on a laptop.

The participation in the Testing Phase will involve the use of data from the MIMIC database (https://mimic.mit.edu/). We have already processed the MIMIC data for the purpose of the Testing Phase. To share this processed data with you, we need you to complete the following:

1. Become a credential user of MIMIC: [https://physionet.org/settings/credentialing/](https://physionet.org/settings/credentialing/)
2. Complete the CITI Course: [https://physionet.org/about/citi-course/](https://physionet.org/about/citi-course/)
3. Sign the following Physionet data use agreements:
   * MIMIC-IV: [https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimiciv/2.2/](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimiciv/2.2/)
   * MIMIC-CXR: [https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-cxr/2.0.0/)
   * MIMIC-IV-ED: [https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-iv-ed/2.2/](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-iv-ed/2.2/)
   * MIMIC-IV-Note: [https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-iv-note/2.2/](https://physionet.org/sign-dua/mimic-iv-note/2.2/)
4. Send us the 5 forms (CITI Course certification + 4 signed data use agreements) to medomics.info@gmail.com

This process will take some time, but we assure you it will be worth it!
